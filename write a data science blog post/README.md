## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code runs with no issues with anaconda jupyter notebook. All we need is python 3 installed on the system.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For the data science blog post, I was interested in using stackoverflow survey 2017 data to analyze the following:

1. Which CompanyType do most coders who have been programming for more than 10 years serve for ?
2. What are the programming languages widely have used by people across the world who have been programming experience for more than 10 years versus less than 10 years?
3. Compare the employment status of people who have formal education in computer science or software engineering ?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is an .ipynb file showing the work related to the questions above.

Data_Science_blog_post.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.
data/2017/survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data.

##Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@venkatapooja.92/are-people-with-work-experience-bagged-by-companies-a39af3991005).
