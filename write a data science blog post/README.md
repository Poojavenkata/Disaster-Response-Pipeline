## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with no issues using python version 3.* .The code uses libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy of anaconda jupyter distribution.

Also, the dataset of StackOverflow 2017 survey can be found in the data folder above.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For the data science blog post, I was interested in using stackoverflow survey 2017 data to analyze the following:

1. Which CompanyType do most coders who have been programming for more than 10 years serve for ?
2. What are the programming languages widely have used by people across the world who have been programming experience for more than 10 years versus less than 10 years?
3. Check the employment status of people who have formal education in computer science or software engineering ?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is an .ipynb file showing the work related to the questions above.

Data_Science_blog_post.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.
data/2017/survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
From the analysis, it is found that,

1. 10 years or more work-experienced coders work for privately-held organizations that are not in a startup mode.
2. JavaScript, SQL, C#, Java, Python, PHP, C++ and C languages share popularity amongst coders with and without experience.
3. Majority of programmers who have a formal education in Computer science /Software Engineering are employed full-time.

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@venkatapooja.92/are-people-with-work-experience-bagged-by-companies-a39af3991005).
